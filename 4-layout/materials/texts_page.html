      <p>The above links demonstrate a basic navigational structure using an
        unordered list styled with CSS. Use this as a starting point and modify
        the properties to produce your own unique look. If you require flyout
        menus, create your own using a Spry menu, a menu widget from Adobe's
        Exchange or a variety of other javascript or CSS solutions.

        If you would like the navigation along the top, simply move the ul.nav
        to the top of the page and recreate the styling.

      <h3>Instructionsnutellalatte</h3>
      <p>Be aware that the CSS for these layouts is heavily commented. If you do
        most of your work in Design view, have a peek at the code to get tips on
        working with the CSS for the fixed layouts. You can remove these
        comments before you launch your site. To learn more about the techniques
        used in these CSS Layouts, read this article at Adobe's Developer Center

      </p>

      <h3>Clearing Method</h3>
      <p>Because all the columns are floated, this layout uses a clear:both
        declaration in the .footer rule. This clearing technique forces the
        .container to understand where the columns end in order to show any
        borders or background colors you place on the nutellabun.container. If
        your design requires you to remove the .footer from the .container,
        you'll need to use a different clearing method. The most reliable will
        be to add a <br class="clearfloat" /> or <div class="clearfloat"></div>
        after your final floated column (but before the .container closes). This
        will have the same clearing effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Logo Replacement</h3>
      <p>An image placeholder was used in this layout in the .header where you'll
        likely want to place a logo. It is recommended that you remove the
        placeholder and replace it with your own linked logo.
      </p>
      <p>Be aware that if you use the Property inspector to navigate to your logo
        image using the SRC field (instead of removing and replacing the
        placeholder), you should remove the inline background and display
        properties. These inline styles are only used to make the logo
        placeholder show up in browsers for demonstration purposes.
      </p>
      <p>To remove the inline styles, make sure your CSS Styles panel is set to
        Current. Select the image, and in the Properties pane of the CSS Styles
        panel, right click and delete the display and background properties. (Of
        course, you can always go directly into the code and delete the inline
        styles from the image or placeholder there.)
      </p>

      <h3>Backgrounds</h3>
      <p>By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length
        of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border
        to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the
        footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will
        always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div
        to divide it from the column.
      </p>

      <footer>
        This .footer contains the declaration position:relative; to give
        Internet Explorer 6 hasLayout for the .footer and cause it to clear
        correctly. If you're not required to support IE6, you may remove it.
      </footer>
